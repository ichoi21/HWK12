# Unit 12 (14) Sequelize: Reverse Engineering Code

## Description

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

```
AS A developer
I WANT a walk-through of the codebase
SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

### Contents

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the `Develop` folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining _every_ file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

You are required to submit the following:

- A link to a Google Doc or video explaining the application in `Develop/`.

```md
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```
